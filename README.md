# Horror Castle Game

## ABOUT
When I was a child, I had this idea of creating a horror adventure game in powerpoint. I created all the artwork and had the locations connected inside the powerpoint but I couldn't figure out how to implement the key collecting and unlocking the doors based on collected keys. Fast forward some fifteen years later, I found the pictures when cleaning out my childhood room, so I'm going to finish the game now using HTML and JavaScript.
